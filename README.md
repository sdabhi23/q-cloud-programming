This repo contains implementations of a few programs which can run on simulators as well as actual quantum hardware written using libraries provided by major quantum software stack providers.

Instructions for installing external dependecies and configuring each cloud provider are available in the respective folders.

Work till commit [388d874](https://github.com/sdabhi23/q-cloud-programming/tree/388d874e0e198f5961a9e394a2c9262d398494b2) was done during internship at Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions (RBEI)

## Remarks

- Programs implemented as a part of IBM Quantum Challenge (May 2020):

  - Basics of Qiskit
  - Quantum key distribution (using BB84 algorithm)
  - Error correction
  - Circuit Optimization

- Reference implementation for quantum teleportation: <https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/examples/quantum_teleportation.py>

- BB84 algorithm: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BB84>

- Waiting for access to systems:

  - Google's Quantum Engine API
  - Rigetti's cloud QPU
  - Zapata's Orquestra
  - Microsoft's Azure Quantum

- The concepts of operations used in Xanadu's photonic quantum computers are completely different from superconducting and ion-trap based quantum computers.

- WIP

  - Implementation of any algorithm using Q# and QDK
